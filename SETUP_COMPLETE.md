## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development Server

```bash
cd cat-training-simulator
npm run dev
```

The simulator will be available at: **http://localhost:5173/** (or the next available port)

### Production Build

```bash
cd cat-training-simulator
npm run build
```

## ✨ What's Included

### Components (8 files)
- `CatSimulator.tsx` - Main wrapper component
- `ScenarioSelection.tsx` - Scenario selection screen
- `SimulatorLab.tsx` - Main simulation interface
- `CatStage.tsx` - Animated cat and visual feedback
- `SimulatorControls.tsx` - Intervention and schedule controls
- `SimulatorGraph.tsx` - Real-time behavior rate graphs
- `EventFeed.tsx` - Event logging system
- `SessionSummaryModal.tsx` - Session results and insights

### Styles (7 CSS files)
- Complete styling for all components
- Beautiful animations and transitions
- Fully responsive design
- Modern gradient themes

### Core Logic
- `types/simulator.ts` - Complete type system with 4 scenarios
- `utils/simulationEngine.ts` - Sophisticated behavioral simulation engine
- Real-time simulation at 10 Hz
- Dynamic MO, satiation, and extinction burst modeling

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Complete project documentation
- `CAT_SIMULATOR_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive user guide (200+ lines)

## 🧹 Cleanup Done

### ABA Intervention Tracker
- ✅ Removed simulator tab from navigation
- ✅ Removed simulator imports from App.tsx
- ✅ Original functionality fully restored
- ⚠️ Simulator files left in place (not actively used) - you can delete `src/components/simulator/`, `src/styles/`, `src/types/simulator.ts`, and `src/utils/simulationEngine.ts` if you want

## 🎯 Features

- 4 training scenarios (Jumping, Meowing, Sitting, Scratching)
- 6 intervention types (DRA, DRO, DRI, NCR, Extinction, Punishment)
- 6 reinforcement schedules (CRF, FR, VR, FI, VI, EXT)
- Real-time behavioral modeling
- Animated cat with behavior-specific animations
- Live Plotly graphs
- Event logging system
- Session summaries with KPIs and insights

## 📊 Build Status

✅ TypeScript compilation: **SUCCESS**
✅ Production build: **SUCCESS**
✅ No linter errors
✅ All dependencies installed

## 🎮 How to Use

1. Start the dev server
2. Select a scenario from the grid
3. Configure your intervention and schedule
4. Watch the cat behave and see real-time graphs
5. Review session summary with performance insights

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Mobile browsers (responsive)

## 🔗 Next Steps

1. **Try it out**: `cd cat-training-simulator && npm run dev`
2. **Read the guide**: Check out `CAT_SIMULATOR_GUIDE.md`
3. **Customize**: Modify scenarios, add new interventions, adjust simulations
4. **Deploy**: Build and host on any static hosting service

## 💡 Tips

- Start with "Jumping on Counter" scenario (Easy)
- Try DRA intervention with VI-8 schedule for alternative behavior
- Watch for extinction bursts when using extinction
- Monitor satiation levels - take breaks if needed
- Run multiple sessions to see long-term effects

**Enjoy your standalone Cat Training Simulator! 🐱✨**

All files are production-ready and the project is completely independent from the ABA tracker.
