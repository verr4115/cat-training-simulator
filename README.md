# üê± Cat Training Simulator - BCBA Training Lab

An interactive educational tool for BCBA (Board Certified Behavior Analyst) trainees to learn about reinforcement strategies, schedules, and interventions through hands-on practice with a virtual cat.

## Overview

Learn how different reinforcement strategies affect behavior over time by acting as the "BCBA-in-training" while the virtual cat acts as the learner. Choose when and how to reinforce, and watch how the cat's behavior changes in real-time!

## Features

### Four Training Scenarios
- **Jumping on Counter** (Easy) - Reduce counter-jumping by reinforcing sitting on the floor
- **Constant Meowing** (Medium) - Reduce excessive meowing through quiet behavior reinforcement
- **Sitting Calmly** (Easy) - Increase calm sitting for grooming or vet visits (Still developing)
- **Scratching Couch** (Hard) - Replace couch scratching with scratching post use (Still developing)

### Real-Time Behavioral Modeling
- **Motivation Operations (MO)** - Adjustable motivation levels
- **Satiation** - Increases with reinforcement, reduces effectiveness
- **Extinction Burst** - Automatic detection and visualization
- **Behavior Competition** - Target vs. alternative behavior dynamics
- **Live Graphs** - Real-time behavior rate visualization with Plotly

## Learning Objectives
By using this simulator, BCBA trainees will learn to:
- Identify appropriate interventions for different behavioral goals
- Understand the effects of different reinforcement schedules
- Recognize extinction bursts and respond appropriately
- Manage establishing operations and satiation
- Interpret behavior rate changes and inter-response times
- Make data-based decisions about intervention adjustments
- Practice ethical decision-making

## Technologies Used
- **React 19** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Plotly.js** - Interactive graphing
- **Modern CSS** - Animations and responsive design

## Educational Use Cases
- BCBA training programs
- University ABA courses
- Self-paced learning for behavior analysts
- Workshop demonstrations
- Understanding schedule effects
- Practicing intervention selection

## Privacy & Ethics
- **No Data Collection** - All simulation runs locally in your browser
- **Ethical Warnings** - Punishment use includes clear warnings about side effects
- **Evidence-Based** - Based on ABA principles and research literature
